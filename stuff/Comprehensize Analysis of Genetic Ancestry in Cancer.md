## Comprehensive Analysis of Genetic Ancestry and Its Molecular Correlates in Cancer
https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108(20)30211-7.pdf

## Data
- 10K individuals in dataset, 8.8K were EUR, 669 EAS, 651 were AFR, 454 were admixed, 41 were hispanic /Latin
- 33 cancer types, 13 of which divided into subtypes

## Points
- Tissue specific analyses had lower power 
- Ancestry effects tend to be cancer type specific
- Very little of the cancer genome was differentially methylated across ancestries
- SPATC1L was one of a few genes that was differentially methylated across ancestries. SPATC1L specifically was differentially methylated between African and European populations, and seemed to affect transcription negatively with increased methylation. 
- 374 CpG sites in total exhibited significant ancestry associations, most of these associations were validated in other datasets. 80% of these CpG islands were correlated with at least one neighboring CpG island, and 40% were correlated with over 10 neighboring CpG islands. These validation datasets were non-neoplastic, indicating that this differential methylation applies to healthy tissue as well as cancer.
- miRNAs were 4 fold different within cancer subtypes at times, however there were no significant differences in miRNA expression between ancestries, not even a two fold change was observed. 
- Germline variation can partially explain differences in mRNA expression across populations in a cancer type specific manner
differential methylation could account for only 3.3% of differentially expressed genes
- These analyses suggest contributions of ancestry to cancer-related pathway activity
- suggests that ancestry should be taken into account when evaluating immunotherapy response.
- An analysis of mRNA profiles from several dozen non- neoplastic tissues found that differences between AFR and EUR tended to be shared across tissue types
- The sources of these ancestry associations are unclear. eQTL analyses indicated that germline genetic differences could explain much of the differences in mRNA expression, but varied environmental exposures may also be a major contributor
- found that uneven distributions of ancestry groups between cancer subtypes was a major confounder.
